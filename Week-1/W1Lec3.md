# Hypothesis Space and Inductive Bias

## Inductive Learing or Prediction
- Given examples or data of form (x , y) / (x, f(x))
  - **Classification Problems:** f(x) is discrete
  - **Regression Problems**: f(x) is continuous
  - **Probability Estimation:** f(x) is the probability of x
**
Why inductive learning**: Given data, use induction, as opposed to deduction, to try and identify a function that predicts the data.

Features: Properties that describe each instance

If multiple features, use feature vector.

### Feature Space

Recall Vector Space

For n features, we define a n fimentional "feature" space, similar to vector spaces. Each instance becomes a point in the feature space.
